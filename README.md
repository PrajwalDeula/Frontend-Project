This is  my multi-step form with validation project. With the limited time in hand, the form lacks client-side validation and interactivity features. 

I've used three forms, inside of which are  input, previous, and next buttons, along with the animation; for instance, when you are on page 1, if you click on next, the color is changed. The feature, like requiring all input fields before proceeding to the next step, is missing.


Below is a snippet of codes as well as output after each step.

Here is the start of the project, which is an HTML document consisting of basic structures like <head> <body> and <link> elements.

Below is a snippet of a CSS file.

The javascript file includes the use of foreach loop, addEventListener, queryselectorall, etc, to change how the HTML and css file interacts with each other to create responsiveness.
