This is  my multi-step form with validation project. With the limited time in hand, the form lacks client-side validation and interactivity features. 
Ive used three forms and inside that Ive added input, previous and next button along with the animation, for instance when you are on page 1 if you click on next, the color is changed.
Below Ive added snippets of codes as well as output after each steps.
